//excersise-1
// gravity mapping was missing so i have adeded it to MoonDTO
// and moon and calculated average and created constant for having logging in console.


/// one drawback is as its taking too long to display data instead
// we can fetch planets and then display their gravity value one by one instead fetching all at one


// We need to collect all the information required and we can run all the three api's
// parallely that would be helpful in the optimization
